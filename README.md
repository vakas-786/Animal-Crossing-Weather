# Animal Crossing Weather App 
An animal crossing themed weather app with dark mode compatability. Users can check the weather and view randomized quotes from Animal Crossing Characters. Live weather data was provided from the Open Weather API and the quotes were provided by a custom built <a href="https://github.com/vakas-786/mod-3-project-BACKEND">Ruby on Rails API.</a>

## Reflection 
Learning how to use the Core Location framework was a pleasure. Networking was slightly challenging at first as I had to spend a good amount of time getting familiar with URLSession. However, once I understood the basics I was able to not only parse JSON data from the open weather API but also from my Rails API that I had built for a previous project. I saw firsthand the benefits of the delegate design pattern after using it for this project as well.
